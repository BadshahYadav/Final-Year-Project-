# Android Malware Detection Project â€” Modular Signal-Processing Pipeline

## Overview

This project implements a modular, signal-processing-inspired pipeline for Android malware detection. The main innovation is in extracting features from APK files using Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) error, treating the APK's bytecode as a 1D signal. The workflow is divided into four clear, file-based stages, each handled by a separate Python script for maximum modularity and reusability.
